# Setup Basic Routing Structure

**Status:** Completed

## Overview
Create initial route structure for main pages (home, about, contact, privacy, terms).

## Goals
- Create static page routes
- Set up basic layout structure
- Add placeholder content

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Routes created: `/`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/privacy`, `/terms`
- [x] Basic layout with header/footer structure using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
- [x] Routes render successfully

## Technical Notes
- Keep simple for now - just structure, no styling
- We'll add i18n routing later in a separate task
- Use SvelteKit 5 conventions
